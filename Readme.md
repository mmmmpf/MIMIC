MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) is a publicly available database containing deidentified health-related data for ICU patients. 

We will explore the patient data, and compare how classical models will predict the mortality of patients compared to a DNN model.

Classical models:
* Logistical regression
* linear regression
* SVM
* KNN
* Decision Tree
* PCA
* t-SNE
* K-means
